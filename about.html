    I'm an aspiring scientist, mountain climber, avid reader, and soon-to-be graduate of UMass Amherst. During my undergraduate career, I studied microbiology with a minor in english.

    Yes, I know what you're thinking. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Is she going to... write a novel... about a <i>C. diff</i> infection...? 
    
    <br>
    <br>
        
    Maybe one day. But first, I'd like to focus on a way to integrate my lust for adventure (three days after graduation, I will be heading out to Wyoming to work in the mountains for 6 months), with my love for science (<i> E. coli</i> is my dearest friend). After my mountainous expedition, I hope to go to graduate school (admissions officer -- if you're reading this, please accept me!), and then take my talents to the Peace Corps or a similar organization. I want to spread knowledge and inspire adventure in young girls that are not as fortunate as I am to have experienced such cumulation of the two things that I love most.

    Aside from these dreams, I do have experience in the real world. I am well-versed in a multitude of lab techniques, and have held two research assistant positions as well as a laboratory TA position. Check out my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> for more info on that.
